<!--
	MusicXML is designed to represent musical scores,
	specifically common western musical notation from the
	17th century onwards. It is designed as an interchange
	format for notation, analysis, retrieval, and performance
	applications. Therefore it is intended to be sufficient,
	not optimal, for these applications.
	
	MusicXML is based on the MuseData and Humdrum formats.
	Humdrum explicitly represents the two-dimensional nature
	of musical scores by a 2-D layout notation. Since XML
	is a hierarchical format, we cannot do this explicitly.
	Instead, there are two top-level formats:
	
	partwise.dtd   Represents scores by part/instrument
	timewise.dtd   Represents scores by time/measure
	
	Thus partwise.dtd contains measures within each part,
	while timewise.dtd contains parts within each measure.
	XSLT stylesheets are provided to convert between the
	two formats.
	
	The partwise and timewise score DTDs represent a single 
	movement of music. Multiple movements or other musical 
	collections are presented using opus.dtd. An opus
	document contains XLinks to individual scores.
	
	Suggested use:
	
	<!DOCTYPE score-timewise PUBLIC
		"-//Recordare//DTD MusicXML 1.1 Timewise//EN"
		"http://www.musicxml.org/dtds/timewise.dtd">
	
	This DTD is made up of a series of component DTDs, all
	of which are included here.
-->

<!-- Entities -->

<!--
	The partwise and timewise entities are used with
	conditional sections to control the differences between
	the partwise and timewise DTDs. The values for these
	entities are what distinguish the partwise and timewise
	DTD files.

	The start-stop and start-stop-continue entities are used 
	for musical elements that can either start or stop, such 
	as slurs, tuplets, and wedges. The start-stop-continue
	entity is used when there is a need to refer to an

	bottom part of a vertical shape like non-arpeggiate.
-->
<!ENTITY % top-bottom "(top | bottom)">


<!--
	The position attributes are based on MuseData print
	suggestions. For most elements, any program will compute
	a default x and y position. The position attributes let
	this be changed two ways. 

	The default-x and default-y attributes change the 
	computation of the default position. For most elements,
	the origin is changed relative to the left-hand side of
	the note or the musical position within the bar (x) and
	the top line of the staff (y).

	For the following elements, the default-x value changes
	the origin relative to the start of the current measure:

		- note
		- figured-bass
		- harmony
		- link
		- directive
		- all descendants of the part-list element
		- all children of the direction-type element

	For the note, figured-bass, and harmony elements, the 
	default-x value is considered to have adjusted the 
	musical position within the bar for its descendant 
	elements.

	Since the <credit-words> element is not related to a
	measure, in this case the default-x and default-y 
	attributes adjust the origin relative to the bottom 
	left-hand corner of the first page.

	The relative-x and relative-y attributes change the 
	position relative to the default position, either as 
	computed by the individual program, or as overridden by 
	the default-x and default-y attributes.
	
	Positive x is right, negative x is left; positive y
	is up, negative y is down. All units are in tenths of
	interline space. For stems, positive relative-y 
	lengthens a stem while negative relative-y shortens it.

	As elsewhere in MusicXML, tenths are the global tenths 
	defined by the <scaling> element, not the local tenths
	of a staff resized by the <staff-size> element.

	above or below another element, such as a note or a
	notation.
-->
<!ENTITY % placement
	"placement (above | below) #IMPLIED">

<!--
	The orientation attribute indicates whether slurs and
	ties are overhand (tips down) or underhand (tips up).
	This is distinct from the placement entity used by any
	notation type.
-->
<!ENTITY % orientation
	"orientation (over | under) #IMPLIED">

<!--
	The bezier entity is used to indicate the curvature of
	slurs and ties, representing the control points for a 
	cubic bezier curve. For ties, the bezier entity is 
	used with the tied element.

	Normal slurs, S-shaped slurs, and ties need only two 
	bezier points: one associated with the start of the slur 
	or tie, the other with the stop. Complex slurs and slurs 
	divided over system breaks can specify additional 
	bezier data at slur elements with a continue type.
	
	The bezier-offset, bezier-x, and bezier-y attributes
	describe the outgoing bezier point for slurs and ties 
	with a start type, and the incoming bezier point for
	slurs and ties with types of stop or continue. The 
	attributes bezier-offset2, bezier-x2, and bezier-y2 
	are only valid with slurs of type continue, and 
	describe the outgoing bezier point.
	
	The bezier-offset and bezier-offset2 attributes are
	measured in terms of musical divisions, like the offset
	element. These are the recommended attributes for
	specifying horizontal position. The other attributes
	are specified in tenths, relative to any position 
	settings associated with the slur or tied element.

<!--
	Slurs, tuplets, and many other features can be
	concurrent and overlapping within a single musical
	part. The number-level attribute distinguishes up to
	six concurrent objects of the same type. A reading
	program should be prepared to handle cases where
	the number-levels stop in an arbitrary order.
	Different numbers are needed when the features
	overlap in MusicXML file order.
-->
<!ENTITY % number-level "(1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6)">

<!--
	MusicXML supports six levels of beaming, up to 256th 
	notes. Unlike the number-level attribute, the beam-level
	identifies concurrent beams in a beam group. It does not
	distinguish overlapping beams such as grace notes within
	regular notes, or beams used in different voices.
-->
<!ENTITY % beam-level "(1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6)">

<!--
	The font entity gathers together attributes for
	determining the font within a directive or direction.
	They are based on the text styles for Cascading
	Style Sheets. The font-family is a comma-separated list
	of font names. These can be specific font styles such
	as Maestro or Opus, or one of three generic font styles:
	music, serif, or sans-serif. The font-style can be 
	normal or italic. The font-size can be one of the CSS 
	sizes (xx-small, x-small, small, medium, large, x-large,
	xx-large) or a numeric point size. The font-weight can 
	be normal or bold. The default is application-dependent,
	but is a text font vs. a music font.

<!--
	The color entity indicates the color of an element.
	Color may be represented as hexadecimal RGB triples,
	as in HTML, or as hexadecimal ARGB tuples, with the
	A indicating alpha of transparency. An alpha value
	of 00 is totally transparent; FF is totally opaque.
	If RGB is used, the A value is assumed to be FF. 

	For instance, the RGB value "#800080" represents
	purple. An ARGB value of "#40800080" would be a
	transparent purple.

	As in SVG 1.1, colors are defined in terms of the
	sRGB color space (IEC 61966).
-->
<!ENTITY % color
	"color CDATA #IMPLIED">

<!--
	The justify entity is used to indicate left, center,
	or right justification. The default value varies for
	different elements.
-->
<!ENTITY % justify
	"justify (left | center | right) #IMPLIED">

<!--
	In cases where text extends over more than one line, 
	horizontal alignment and justify values can be 
	different. The most typical case is for credits, 
	such as:

		Words and music by
		  Pat Songwriter

	Typically this type of credit is aligned to the right,
	so that the position information refers to the right-
	most part of the text. But in this example, the text 
	is center-justified, not right-justified.

	The halign attribute is used in these situations. If it 
	is not present, its value is the same as for the justify
	attribute.
-->
<!ENTITY % halign
	"halign (left | center | right) #IMPLIED">

<!--
	The valign entity is used to indicate vertical
	alignment to the top, middle, bottom, or baseline 
	of the text. Defaults are implementation-dependent.

	The line-shape entity is used to distinguish between
	straight and curved lines. The line-type entity
	distinguishes between solid, dashed, dotted, and
	wavy lines.

	"line-shape (straight | curved) #IMPLIED">

<!ENTITY % line-type

<!--
	The printout entity is based on MuseData print
	suggestions. They allow a way to specify not to print
	print an object (e.g. note or rest), its augmentation
	dots, or its lyrics. This is especially useful for notes 
	that overlap in different voices, or for chord sheets
	that contain lyrics and chords but no melody. For wholly
	invisible notes, such as those providing sound-only data,
	the attribute for print-spacing may be set to no so that
	no space is left for this note. The print-spacing value
	is only used if no note, dot, or lyric is being printed.

	By default, all these attributes are set to yes. If 
	print-object is set to no, print-dot and print-lyric are
	interpreted to also be set to no if they are not present.

<!--
	The trill-sound entity includes attributes used to guide
	the sound of trills, mordents, turns, shakes, and wavy
	lines, based on MuseData sound suggestions. The default
	choices are:
	
		start-note = "upper"
		trill-step = "whole"
		two-note-turn = "none"
		accelerate = "no"
		beats = "4" (minimum of "2").
	
	Second-beat and last-beat are percentages for landing
	on the indicated beat, with defaults of 25 and 75
	respectively.
	
	For mordent and inverted-mordent elements, the defaults
	are different:
	
		The default start-note is "main", not "upper".
		The default for beats is "3", not "4".
		The default for second-beat is "12", not "25".
		The default for last-beat is "24", not "75".

	The bend-sound entity is used for bend and slide
	elements, and is similar to the trill-sound. Here the
	beats element refers to the number of discrete elements
	(like MIDI pitch bends) used to represent a continuous
	bend or slide. The first-beat indicates the percentage
	of the direction for starting a bend; the last-beat the
	percentage for ending it. The default choices are:

	join the print and sound elements in providing 
	formatting data as elements rather than attributes.

	Everything is measured in tenths of staff space.
	Tenths are then scaled to millimeters within the
	scaling element, used in the defaults element at
	the start of a score. Individual staves can apply
	a scaling factor to adjust staff size. When a
	MusicXML element or attribute refers to tenths,
	it means the global tenths defined by the scaling
	element, not the local tenths as adjusted by the
	staff-size element.
-->

<!-- Elements -->

<!--
	Margins, page sizes, and distances are all measured in
	tenths to keep MusicXML data in a consistent coordinate
	system as much as possible. The translation to absolute
	units is done in the scaling element, which specifies
	how many millimeters are equal to how many tenths. For
	a staff height of 7 mm, millimeters would be set to 7
	while tenths is set to 40. The ability to set a formula
	rather than a single scaling factor helps avoid roundoff
	errors.

	and staving.
-->
<!ELEMENT attributes (%editorial;, divisions?, key?, time?,

<!--	
	Traditional key signatures are represented by the number
	of flats and sharps, plus an optional mode for major/
	minor/mode distinctions. Negative numbers are used for
	flats and positive numbers for sharps, reflecting the
	key's placement within the circle of fifths (hence the
	element name). A cancel element indicates that the old
	key signature should be cancelled before the new one
	appears. This will always happen when changing to C major
	or A minor and need not be specified then. The cancel
	value matches the fifths value of the cancelled key
	signature (e.g., a cancel of -2 will provide an explicit
	cancellation for changing from B flat major to F major).
	
	Non-traditional key signatures can be represented using
	the Humdrum/Scot concept of a list of altered tones.
	The key-step and key-alter elements are represented the
	same way as the step and alter elements are in the pitch
	element in note.dtd. The different element names indicate
	the different meaning of altering notes in a scale versus
	altering a sounding pitch.
	
	Valid mode values include major, minor, dorian, phrygian,
	lydian, mixolydian, aeolian, ionian, and locrian.

	The optional number attribute refers to staff numbers, 
	from top to bottom on the system. If absent, the key
	signature applies to all staves in the part.

<!--
	Musical notation duration is commonly represented as
	fractions. The divisions element indicates how many 
	divisions per quarter note are used to indicate a note's
	duration. For example, if duration = 1 and divisions = 2,
	this is an eighth note duration. Duration and divisions
	are used directly for generating sound output, so they
	must be chosen to take tuplets into account. Using a
	divisions element lets us use just one number to 
	represent a duration for each note in the score, while
	retaining the full power of a fractional representation.
	For maximum compatibility with Standard MIDI Files, the
	divisions value should not exceed 16383.
-->
<!ELEMENT divisions (#PCDATA)>

<!--
	Time signatures are represented by two elements. The
	beats element indicates the number of beats, as found in
	the numerator of a time signature. The beat-type element
	indicates the beat unit, as found in the denominator of
	a time signature. The symbol attribute is used to
	indicate another notation beyond a fraction: the common 
	and cut time symbols, as well as a single number with an
	implied denominator. Normal (a fraction) is the implied
	symbol type if none is specified. Multiple pairs of
	beat and beat-type elements are used for composite
	time signatures with multiple denominators, such as
	2/4 + 3/8. A composite such as 3+2/8 requires only one
	beat/beat-type pair. A senza-misura element explicitly
	indicates that no time signature is present. 

	The print-object attribute allows a time signature to be
	specified but not printed, as is the case for excerpts
	from the middle of a score. The value is "yes" if
	not present. The optional number attribute refers to staff
	numbers, from top to bottom on the system. If absent, the 
	time signature applies to all staves in the part.

	Clefs are represented by the sign, line, and
	clef-octave-change elements. Sign values include G, F, C,
	percussion, TAB, and none. Line numbers are counted from
	the bottom of the staff. Standard values are 2 for the
	G sign (treble clef), 4 for the F sign (bass clef), 3 
	for the C sign (alto clef) and 5 for TAB (on a 6-line
	staff). The clef-octave-change element is used for
	transposing clefs (e.g., a treble clef for tenors would
	have a clef-octave-change value of -1). The optional 
	number attribute refers to staff numbers, from top to
	bottom on the system. A value of 1 is assumed if not
	present.

	as the prior staff, but displayed differently (e.g.,
	treble and bass clef, standard notation and tab).
	The staff-lines element specifies the number of lines for
	non 5-line staffs. The staff-tuning and capo elements are
	used to specify tuning when using tablature notation.
	The optional number attribute specifies the staff number
	from top to bottom on the system, as with clef. The
	optional show-frets attribute indicates whether to show
	tablature frets as numbers (0, 1, 2) or letters (a, b, c).
	The default choice is numbers. The print-object attribute
	is used to indicate when a staff is not printed in a part,
	usually in large scores where empty parts are omitted.
	It is yes by default. If print-spacing is yes while
	print-object is no, the score is printed in cutaway

	and doubling an octave down. The chromatic and
	octave-change elements are numeric values added to the
	encoded pitch data to create the sounding pitch. The

	If a barline is other than a normal single barline, it
	should be represented by a barline element that describes
	it. This includes information about repeats and multiple
	endings, as well as line style. Barline data is on the
	same level as the other musical data in a score - a child
	of a measure in a partwise score, or a part in a timewise
	score. This allows for barlines within measures, as in
	dotted barlines that subdivide measures in complex
	meters. The two fermata elements allow for fermatas
	on both sides of the barline (the lower one inverted).
	
	Barlines have a location attribute to make it easier to
	process barlines independently of the other musical data
	in a score. It is often easier to set up measures
	separately from entering notes. The location attribute
	must match where the barline element occurs within the
	rest of the musical data in the score. If location is
	left, it should be the first element in the measure; if
	location is right, it should be the last element. If no
	location is specified, the right barline is the default.

	The new-system and new-page attributes indicate whether
	to force a system or page break, or to force the current
	music onto the same system or page as the preceding 
	music. Normally this is the first music data within a
	measure. If used in multi-part music, they should be

<!-- 
	The sound element contains general playback parameters.
	They can stand alone within a part/measure, or be a
	component element within a direction.
	
	Tempo is expressed in quarter notes per minute. If 0,
	the sound-generating program must prompt the user at the
	time of compiling a sound (MIDI) file.
	
	Dynamics (or MIDI velocity) are expressed as a percentage
	of the default forte value (90 for MIDI).
	
	Dacapo indicates to go back to the beginning of the
	movement. When used it always has the value "yes".
	
	Segno and dalsegno are used for backwards jumps to a
	segno sign; coda and tocoda are used for forward jumps
	to a coda sign. If there are multiple jumps, the value
	of these parameters can be used to name and distinguish
	them. If segno or coda is used, the divisions attribute
	can also be used to indicate the number of divisions
	per quarter note. Otherwise sound and MIDI generating
	programs may have to recompute this.
	
	A dalsegno or dacapo attribute indicates that the
	jump should occur the first time through; a tocoda
	attribute indicates the jump should occur the second
	time through.
	
	Forward-repeat is used when a forward repeat sign is
	implied, and usually follows a bar line. When used it
	always has the value of "yes".
	
	The fine attribute follows the final note or rest in a
	movement with a da capo direction. If numeric, the value
	represents the actual duration of the final note or rest,
	which can be ambiguous in written notation and different
	among parts and voices. The value may also be "yes" to
	indicate no change to the final duration.
	
	If the sound element applies only one time through a
	repeat, the time-only attribute indicates which time
	to apply the sound element.
	
	Pizzicato in a sound element effects all following notes.
	Yes indicates pizzicato, no indicates arco.
	
	Pan and elevation allow placing of sound in a 3-D space
	relative to the listener. Both are expressed in degrees
	ranging from -180 to 180. For pan, 0 is straight ahead,
	-90 is hard left, 90 is hard right, and -180 and 180
	are directly behind the listener. For elevation, 0 is
	level with the listener, 90 is directly above, and -90
	is directly below.
	
	The damper-pedal, soft-pedal, and sostenuto-pedal 
	attributes effect playback of the three common piano
	pedals and their MIDI controller equivalents. Yes
	indicates the pedal is depressed; no indicates the 
	pedal is released.
	
	MIDI instruments are changed using the midi-instrument
	element defined in common.dtd.
